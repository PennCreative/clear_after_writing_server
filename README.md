# Clear After Writing

A full stack journal inspired application built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and NextJS for the front end and Python/ Django for the backend. Once the user starts journaling, they will see their own individual calendar turn into a mosaic that directly corresponds with how their days are rated.
